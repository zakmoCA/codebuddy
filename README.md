## work log and journal

### journal

#### **04/12 - 05/12:** 

better health than in recent weeks, capitalise on days/evenings like this. 
- idea of working at pace/level of current symptom level was good. 
- even just writing out the controller actions and model skeletons was **much better** than doing nothing due because too sick for proper coding as normal. there is always some amount which is feasible, doesn't need to be all or nothing

**notes**

- model relationships next up --> routing --> user auth TODO later today 05/12
